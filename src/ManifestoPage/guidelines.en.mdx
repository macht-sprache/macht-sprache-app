<CollapsableSection title="Context-specificity">

A politically sensitive translation will always be context specific. The word ‘c\*loured’, for instance, was regarded as an acceptable and even empowering term in the USA by anti-racism activists and organisation at one time, but is now understood as offensive [link to harmful terms]. The same term carries an altogether different weight in South Africa, where it served as a racial categorisation relevant for apartheid legislation and is often not viewed as being as offensive as in the North American context today. The perhaps obvious German translation ‘farbig’ is again different, having never been wielded with any kind of empowering content, nor as a legislative term. The context specificity of this term cuts across dimensions of time, geography and different socio-cultural discourses.

In the recommendations made by this tool, it is always important to consider the particular context of which a) the source text is a part and b) into which the translated text will emerge. These contexts can be fundamental to determining what a politically sensitive translation is. Questions of type of text or genre (from a short social media post to an event announcement, a blog post, a historical novel or an academic book) and register [link] and tone and attitude [link] can also be a form of context specificity.

The context-specificity of a politically sensitive translation calls for context sensitivity from the translator. Such sensitivity is often more likely to be possessed by those who occupy ‘translatable’ positionalities, i.e. are in a position to relate to the discrimination that might be at stake in a given text or a given term.

<CollapsableSection title="Positionalities">

The sensitivity of a translation can be dependent on the positionality of the different participants involved in it. To draw on insights given by Mirjam Nuenning, these can be organised into the following groups: the positionality of the author, the positionality of their intended audience, the positionality of the translator, and the positionality of their intended audience. All of these are considerations that should go into assessing what might be a politically sensitive translation. These are important questions, because they speak to the issues of who speaks/who gets to speak and be heard/who has the power to speak and be heard.

The Afro-American writer Toni Morrison was famously outspoken about the fact that she wrote for Black people. When she, a Black woman, chooses to use a racially insulting term like the N-word, it is different to when a white writer chooses to do so for an imagined white audience because Morrison and her imagined readership are positioned in a different relationship to that term and the structures of harm it represents. Similarly, decisions about how to sensitively translate such language are affected by the positionality of the translator, and their imagined audience. Oftentimes, a translator with experiences of a particular form of discrimination is more likely to be attuned to what would constitute a politically sensitive translation in the socio-cultural context of their target language.

Judyta Smykowski, Jonas Karpa und Raul Krauthausen open their Podcast Die Neue Norm by saying “Eine Sehbehinderung und zwei Rollstühle oder drei Journalist\*innen sprechen über Behinderung, Inklusion und Gesellschaft.” When they joke about themselves and their disabilities on their own show, it is different to when an able-bodied person does so. But the show of these three journalists is hosted by “Bayern 3”, the public broadcaster in the German state of Bavaria, which means that they are addressing a general audience of disabled and able-bodied people. They use humour to counter stereotypes of disabled people. Translating their show or producing bilingual social media content for it, would require a translator familiar with the experiences of disabled people, the terminology around disability - disliked/preferred by the community - in Germany and the socio-cultural context of the target language, a person who can capture the humour …. …. … [Link to tone and attitude]

<CollapsableSection title="Genre and register of text">

For a politically sensitive translation, it is important to know what kind of a text you are translating: is it an activist Instagram channel dedicated to radical anti-racism? Is it a book of nature writing intervowen with anecdotes of personal experiences of racism and sexism? Is it a public statement of an institution denouncing anti-semitism?

<CollapsableSection title="Tone and attitude">

Digital tools that work with language and translation seldomly recognise tone and attitude. The aim of this tool is not to encourage humourless translations or censor what might be effective satirical or ironic uses of language which work to undercut the discrimination they put up for scrutiny. Assessing this is something that must remain in the hands of the human translator. The tone and attitude of a text and its translation can, nonetheless, be context-specific [link] and relate significantly to the positionality of author, translator and audience [link].

<CollapsableSection title="Maintaining the original language">

Often, a term is so context specific that to translate it at all seems to come at too great a cost. Between German and English, ‘Race’ might be considered such a term. With most of the frequently suggested options coming up short in significant ways, it often seems the best option to maintain the term in the original language. If this seems to be the case, it’s worth considering whether this can be supplemented by a footnote, bracketed explanation, or other form of explainer that can serve to communicate, in a non-condescending way, the meaning of the term in its original context and the reasons for the choice to maintain it in the original language.

Maintaining the original language also has its drawbacks, which should figure in weighing up the best option for a given translation.
English

As a global lingua franca, English is the language that mediates a great deal of the discussion surrounding political sensitivity. In relation to German, it is often presented as having a ‘more developed’ discourse around many forms of discrimination. It’s worth keeping in mind the discrimination also embedded in English, which is by no means intrinsically progressive or politically sensitive, as well as the history of English as a major colonial language. The English language was a key component of British imperialism’s violent conquest of large parts of the world.
There is also a great deal of difference within English-speaking contexts. Many discourses are perhaps dominated by American English, while others might be disproportionately weighted by discourses established in British English. English is spoken in a variety of ways across the globe, and political sensitivity in English is accordingly context specific [link to context specificity].

<CollapsableSection title="Typographic options">

[question of whether we gather a variety of these here, or only talk about these in general terms]
Could include Lann’s point that gender typographies in German don’t have to be mutually exclusive, we don’t have to pick one form and make it the new rule, there can be several, subject to change and context.
So could have a bit on the Sternchen, on the colon, on the Unterstrich
On capitalising Black or not
On italicising white or just the w, as in white (what they do at worten und meer, I think, or at least in Kindred)
Inserting asterisks as we did for the machtsprache site
Formulations like ‘the N-word’ (this and the above might assume readers know what is meant -> consider what audience knows, consider including a gloss, footnote, bracketed explainer etc)

</CollapsableSection>

<CollapsableSection title="Harmful language/terms">

The use of harmful terminology can be controversial and lead to heated debates. A foremost consideration here should always be the positionality [link] of author and translator. Sometimes, a harmful term has been deliberately used in an original text in order to communicate the pain that some words cause. Censoring the term in translation might thus be to undermine the possibly anti-discriminatory work the original is trying to do, as well as to insert discourses into the translation that are absent in the original (could cite Assaf). At the same time, including hurtful language in ignorance of the possible further harm it may cause in translation is no solution. It is always wise to consult various voices who have experiences of the kind of discrimination in question and see how they feel about the use of a harmful term in translation (see the process they went through for Kindred). This is unlikely to produce a single, unanimous response, but it is important to gather an array of considerations, especially from the perspectives of those likely to be harmed by the term.

If the translation is best served by including a harmful term in some version, it is wise to offer a warning to would-be readers that they may encounter such harmful language in the given text. One can consider a variety of options to create a critical distance to the term and thereby mitigate its power to cause harm. These can include typographic [link] signals like interrupting the word with asterisks, italicising it or refusing to write it out in full. Such options might be more viable when the text is written as opposed to spoken. If a written translation that includes harmful language which is signalled typographically is likely to be read aloud, e.g. in a workshop or discussion round, one can consider including instructions about how to handle this (as they do in the foreword for Kindred).

<CollapsableSection title="Creative solutions">

An enormous array of creative solutions are being sought and developed when it comes to politically sensitive language. As Lann Hornscheidt and many linguists point out, these developments do not necessarily happen in the elite spaces of universities or similar, but are a part of the way language has always changed and adapted to new needs and environments. In fact, there exists a long history of marginalised groups innovating linguistically. Language can become a tool to legitimize experiences and to assert power in cultures that don’t give marginalised groups a lot of ways to do that. Translators can and should seek out creative solutions to the challenges that arise in translating with political sensitivity.
