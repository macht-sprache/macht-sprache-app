## Fundamental principles

### Change and incompleteness

Language changes constantly, as do understandings of what constitutes political sensitivity. While queer was once a slur, after years of hard work, queer communities have successfully appropriated the word for empowering purposes. N***o, by contrast, was once used as a self-designation by Black people fighting racism, but is now generally understood as a racist term. As discussions about political sensitivity grow and develop, so too will the language that best supports them. That means that a tool like the one offered here is subject to ongoing change and development, and that is as it should be. As new problems present themselves, those invested in making language less discriminatory must be willing to develop new strategies to tackle those problems. The project for political sensitivity in translation is not a static one, and the suggestions presented here make no claim to permanence or comprehensiveness. This will always be part of an ongoing learning process.

### Pragmatic [future-oriented, accessible, collaborative, creative]

Many of the questions that arise when considering politically sensitive translation are complex and warrant careful consideration. At the same time, the aim of this tool is to offer a useful aid to people working with translations. As such, we aim to be pragmatic in our recommendations. Translations are rarely perfect, but sometimes decisions need to be made that weigh the different considerations at stake, and opt to prioritise some concerns at the expense of others. In making these pragmatic decisions, it is important to be sensitive to the different factors that need to be weighed.
