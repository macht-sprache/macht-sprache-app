## Aims of the tool/why it matters

This tool aims to support those who translate between English and German in integrating a measure of political sensitivity into their work. It aims to foster and develop an ongoing, productive, collaborative, accessible and, when possible, creative approach to questions of politically sensitive language and translation. It will never be complete or comprehensive, nor can it replace the work of the human translator in developing their own sensibilities in these questions.

Discrimination works in and through language, and to tackle the many problems this presents, it is necessary to develop a sensitivity for how it happens. Sometimes discrimination is so embedded in language that speakers don’t recognise it as discriminatory. This is related to power and privilege: discriminatory language works to perpetuate existing power structures, and being blind to that discrimination is a luxury afforded those with the privilege of not being affected by it.

Thus, it’s important to increase awareness for how discriminatory language is causing harm, so that the need for changing it can become apparent to all. This will not suffice to tackle the discrimination and the injustice of which it is a part, but it is a necessary component of working towards such a goal. To draw on an insight given by linguist and editor Lann Hornscheidt: when there is pushback against changing language, one should ask for whom the change is inconvenient, for whom the formulation is inelegant – and for whom the established norm is making life less liveable. Politically insensitive language causes harm, and politically sensitive language matters because it can work to do less of such harm and make this harm visible as such. To draw on an observation made by author Mithu Sanyal: to argue for more political sensitivity in language and translation is not to politicise issues that don’t need to be politicised. These linguistic decisions are always already political – some are just more visibly so.

This tool is motivated by the desire to name discrimination as such, seek out modes of expression that de-normalise it, and help people who work with translations to integrate these sensitivities into their work.
