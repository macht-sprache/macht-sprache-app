** macht.sprache. aims to support those who translate between English and German to integrate political sensitivity into their work. **

macht.sprache. is motivated by the desire to name discrimination and seek out modes of expression that de-normalise it. The platform hopes to create awareness for linguistic sensitivity in translation and to support users to apply it.

The macht.sprache. project aims to foster and develop an ongoing, collaborative, accessible and creative approach to questions of politically sensitive language and translation. This project will never be [complete or comprehensive](#change-and-incompleteness). macht.sprache. provides support, but cannot do the work of human translators, who can also work towards developing their own sensitivity.

This manifesto offers arguments for the importance of political sensitivity and a number of fundamental principles for translation.

When there is pushback against changing language, one should ask for whom the change is inconvenient, for whom the formulation is inelegant – and for whom the established norm is making life less liveable.

### acknowledging power and privilege

Discrimination works in and through language. To tackle the many problems this presents, it is necessary to develop sensitivity for how it happens. Sometimes discrimination is so embedded in language that speakers don’t even recognise it as discriminatory. This is related to power and privilege: discriminatory language works to perpetuate existing power structures. Being unaware of that discrimination is a luxury afforded those who have the privilege of not being the target of it.

### awareness is one step towards justice

It’s vital to increase awareness for how discriminatory language causes harm. The need for changing established habits of speech should become apparent to all. Awareness and practicing linguistic sensitivity will not suffice to tackle discrimination and injustice. But both are necessary components of working towards justice for all.

### doing harm or reducing harm

To draw on an insight given by linguist and editor Lann Hornscheidt: when there is pushback against changing language, one should ask for whom the change is inconvenient, for whom the formulation is inelegant – and for whom the established norm is making life less liveable. Politically insensitive language causes harm. Politically sensitive language matters because it can work to do less harm. Politically sensitive language can also make this harm visible as such.

### linguistic choices are always political

In any translation, be it a social media post or an entire book, the translator makes choices. Usually there are several options for translating a single word. Therefore, drawing on an observation made by author and critic Mithu Sanyal: to argue for more political sensitivity in language and translation is not to politicise issues that don’t need to be politicised. These linguistic decisions are always already political – some are just more visibly so.
