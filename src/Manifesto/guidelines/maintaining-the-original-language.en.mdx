export const title = 'Maintaining the original language';

Often, a term is so context specific that to translate it at all seems to come at too great a cost. Between German and English, ‘Race’ might be considered such a term. With most of the frequently suggested options coming up short in significant ways, it often seems the best option to maintain the term in the original language. If this seems to be the case, it’s worth considering whether this can be supplemented by a footnote, bracketed explanation, or other form of explainer that can serve to communicate, in a non-condescending way, the meaning of the term in its original context and the reasons for the choice to maintain it in the original language.

Maintaining the original language also has its drawbacks, which should figure in weighing up the best option for a given translation.
English

As a global lingua franca, English is the language that mediates a great deal of the discussion surrounding political sensitivity. In relation to German, it is often presented as having a ‘more developed’ discourse around many forms of discrimination. It’s worth keeping in mind the discrimination also embedded in English, which is by no means intrinsically progressive or politically sensitive, as well as the history of English as a major colonial language. The English language was a key component of British imperialism’s violent conquest of large parts of the world.
There is also a great deal of difference within English-speaking contexts. Many discourses are perhaps dominated by American English, while others might be disproportionately weighted by discourses established in British English. English is spoken in a variety of ways across the globe, and political sensitivity in English is accordingly context specific [link to context specificity].
