For a politically sensitive translation, translators need to know the type or genre of the text they are dealing with, and they need to determine its register. This can depend on grammar, syntax, and tone. Do you want to translate a post for an activist Instagram channel dedicated to radical anti-racism? A book of nature writing intervowen with anecdotes of personal experiences of sexism? A piece of historical fiction? Or a public statement denouncing anti-semitism for an institution?

The appropriate translation will depend on the type of text, its context and purpose. A translator with a penchant for mannered language might be a good fit for translating a historical novel. An institutional statement will require formal diction. When it comes to politically sensitive terms, some may only be known in expert communities, others will sound less jargony or stilted.

Genre and register of a text are also strongly connected to the fundamental principle of [positionalities](#positionalities). Considering who the author’s and translator’s intended audiences are will help the translator choose the right register for the translation.
