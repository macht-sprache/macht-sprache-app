export const title = 'Genre and register of text';

For a politically sensitive translation, it is important to know what kind of a text you are translating: is it an activist Instagram channel dedicated to radical anti-racism? Is it a book of nature writing intervowen with anecdotes of personal experiences of racism and sexism? Is it a public statement of an institution denouncing anti-semitism?
