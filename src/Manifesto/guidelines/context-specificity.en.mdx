A politically sensitive translation will always be context specific. The word ‘c\*loured’, for instance, was regarded as an acceptable and even empowering term in the USA by anti-racism activists and organisation at one time, but is now understood as offensive [link to harmful terms]. The same term carries an altogether different weight in South Africa, where it served as a racial categorisation relevant for apartheid legislation and is often not viewed as being as offensive as in the North American context today. The perhaps obvious German translation ‘farbig’ is again different, having never been wielded with any kind of empowering content, nor as a legislative term. The context specificity of this term cuts across dimensions of time, geography and different socio-cultural discourses.

In the recommendations made by this tool, it is always important to consider the particular context of which a) the source text is a part and b) into which the translated text will emerge. These contexts can be fundamental to determining what a politically sensitive translation is. Questions of type of text or genre (from a short social media post to an event announcement, a blog post, a historical novel or an academic book) and register [link] and tone and attitude [link] can also be a form of context specificity.

The context-specificity of a politically sensitive translation calls for context sensitivity from the translator. Such sensitivity is often more likely to be possessed by those who occupy ‘translatable’ positionalities, i.e. are in a position to relate to the discrimination that might be at stake in a given text or a given term.
