A politically sensitive translation will always be context-specific. The word c\*loured, for instance, was regarded as an acceptable and even empowering term in the USA by anti-racism activists and organisations at one time. Now it is [understood as offensive](#harmful-language). The same term carries an altogether different weight in South Africa, where it served as a racial categorisation in apartheid legislation. The perhaps obvious German translation farbig is again different. This German term has never been wielded with any kind of empowering content, nor as a legislative term. Members of the Black German community and anti-racism researchers discourage the use of this term for many reasons: It suggests that some Black people are not really Black and thus supports colorism; some white Germans use it to be polite, which only shows that they imagine Black to need a euphemism; the term suggests that white is the norm and ‘farbig’ a deviation. The context specificity of this term cuts across dimensions of time, geography and different socio-cultural discourses.

In the recommendations made by the [text checker](/text-checker), it is always important to consider the particular context of which the source text is a part and into which the translated text will emerge. These contexts can be fundamental to determining what a politically sensitive translation is. The type of text or genre (be it a short social media post, an event announcement, a blog post, a historical novel or an academic book), [register](#register), [tone and attitude](tone-and-attitude) can also be forms of context-specificity.

The context-specificity of a politically sensitive translation calls for context sensitivity from the translator. Often, those who occupy ‘translatable' positionalities, i.e. are in a position to relate to the discrimination that might be at stake in a given text or term, are more likely to possess such sensitivity. There is a type of knowledge that comes from experience: ‘Erfahrungswissen’ in German. If one cannot rely on 'Erfahrungswissen’, it is all the more important to familiarise oneself with the context-specific knowledge that the translation requires.
