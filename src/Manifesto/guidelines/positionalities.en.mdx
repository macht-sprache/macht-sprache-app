    'Consider the positionality of the author, the positionality of their intended audience, the positionality of the translator, and the positionality of their intended audience.';

The sensitivity of a translation can depend on the positionality of the different participants involved in it. To draw on insights given by literary translator Mirjam Nuenning, these can be organised into the following groups:

-   the positionality of the author
-   the positionality of the author’s intended audience
-   the positionality of the translator
-   the positionality of the translator’s intended audience.

All of these need to be considered when assessing what might be a politically sensitive translation: who speaks and how is their work understood? Writers decide who they write for, even if they can’t control who actually reads their work. Translators are readers first and interpreters of the work second.

The Afro-American writer Toni Morrison was famously outspoken about the fact that she wrote for Black people. When she, a Black woman, chooses to use a racially insulting term like the [N-word](https://www.machtsprache.de/term/hfIzvOLZliYPrFU6FN4R), it is different to when a white writer chooses to do so for an imagined white audience. Morrison and her imagined readership are positioned in a different relationship to the term and the structures of harm it represents. Similarly, decisions about how to sensitively translate such language are affected by the positionality of the translator and their imagined audience. In the context of translation, the interpretation could start with the question of the purpose behind Morrison’s usage of the term. Who is her imagined audience and what is the purpose of using the N-word in the context of the theme of the story she tells? An audience of Color/Black readers might feel seen by reading about validations of their experiences, whereas white audiences might not. Oftentimes, a translator - who is a reader first - with experiences of a particular form of discrimination is more likely to be attuned to what would constitute a politically sensitive translation in the socio-cultural context of their target language. As with [context-specificity](#context-specificity), their positionality provides people with a certain ‘Erfahrungswissen’ - knowlege gained through experiences.
