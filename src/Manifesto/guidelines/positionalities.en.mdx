The sensitivity of a translation can be dependent on the positionality of the different participants involved in it. To draw on insights given by Mirjam Nuenning, these can be organised into the following groups: the positionality of the author, the positionality of their intended audience, the positionality of the translator, and the positionality of their intended audience. All of these are considerations that should go into assessing what might be a politically sensitive translation. These are important questions, because they speak to the issues of who speaks/who gets to speak and be heard/who has the power to speak and be heard.

The Afro-American writer Toni Morrison was famously outspoken about the fact that she wrote for Black people. When she, a Black woman, chooses to use a racially insulting term like the N-word, it is different to when a white writer chooses to do so for an imagined white audience because Morrison and her imagined readership are positioned in a different relationship to that term and the structures of harm it represents. Similarly, decisions about how to sensitively translate such language are affected by the positionality of the translator, and their imagined audience. Oftentimes, a translator with experiences of a particular form of discrimination is more likely to be attuned to what would constitute a politically sensitive translation in the socio-cultural context of their target language.

Judyta Smykowski, Jonas Karpa und Raul Krauthausen open their Podcast Die Neue Norm by saying “Eine Sehbehinderung und zwei Rollstühle oder drei Journalist\*innen sprechen über Behinderung, Inklusion und Gesellschaft.” When they joke about themselves and their disabilities on their own show, it is different to when an able-bodied person does so. But the show of these three journalists is hosted by “Bayern 3”, the public broadcaster in the German state of Bavaria, which means that they are addressing a general audience of disabled and able-bodied people. They use humour to counter stereotypes of disabled people. Translating their show or producing bilingual social media content for it, would require a translator familiar with the experiences of disabled people, the terminology around disability - disliked/preferred by the community - in Germany and the socio-cultural context of the target language, a person who can capture the humour …. …. … [Link to tone and attitude]
