The use of harmful terminology can be controversial and lead to heated debates. A foremost consideration here should always be the positionality [link] of author and translator. Sometimes, a harmful term has been deliberately used in an original text in order to communicate the pain that some words cause. Censoring the term in translation might thus be to undermine the possibly anti-discriminatory work the original is trying to do, as well as to insert discourses into the translation that are absent in the original (could cite Assaf). At the same time, including hurtful language in ignorance of the possible further harm it may cause in translation is no solution. It is always wise to consult various voices who have experiences of the kind of discrimination in question and see how they feel about the use of a harmful term in translation (see the process they went through for Kindred). This is unlikely to produce a single, unanimous response, but it is important to gather an array of considerations, especially from the perspectives of those likely to be harmed by the term.

If the translation is best served by including a harmful term in some version, it is wise to offer a warning to would-be readers that they may encounter such harmful language in the given text. One can consider a variety of options to create a critical distance to the term and thereby mitigate its power to cause harm. These can include typographic [link] signals like interrupting the word with asterisks, italicising it or refusing to write it out in full. Such options might be more viable when the text is written as opposed to spoken. If a written translation that includes harmful language which is signalled typographically is likely to be read aloud, e.g. in a workshop or discussion round, one can consider including instructions about how to handle this (as they do in the foreword for Kindred).
