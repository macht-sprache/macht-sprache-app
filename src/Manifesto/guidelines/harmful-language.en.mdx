The use of harmful terminology can be controversial and lead to heated debates. A foremost consideration here should always be the [positionality](#positionalities) of author and translator. Sometimes, a harmful term has been deliberately used in an original text in order to communicate the pain that some words cause. Censoring the term in translation might thus be to undermine the anti-discriminatory work the original is trying to do. Inserting discourses into the translation that are absent in the original might also not be appropriate. At the same time, including hurtful language in ignorance of the possible further harm it may cause in translation is no solution.
In their foreword to the 2016 translation of Octavia Butlerâ€™s novel Kindred, literary translator Mirjam Nuenning and novelist Sharon Dodua Otoo offer great advice for dealing with harmful language in translations:

-   It is always wise to **consult various voices** who have experiences of the kind of discrimination in question, to see how they feel about the use of a harmful [term in translation](#collaboration). This is unlikely to produce a single, unanimous response, but it is important to gather an array of considerations, especially from the perspectives of those likely to be harmed by the term.
-   If the translation is best served by including a harmful term in some version, it is wise to **offer a warning** to would-be readers that they may encounter harmful language in the text.
-   One can consider a variety of options to **create critical distance from the term** and thereby mitigate its power to cause harm. These can include [typographic](#typographic-options) signals like interrupting the word with asterisks, italicising it or refusing to write it out in full. Such options might be more viable when the text is written as opposed to spoken.
-   If a written translation that includes harmful language which is signalled typographically is likely to be read aloud, eg. in a workshop or discussion round, one can consider **including instructions** about how to handle this.
