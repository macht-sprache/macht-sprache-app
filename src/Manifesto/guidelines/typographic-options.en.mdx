Instead of using what has been established as ‘correct grammar’, translators (and writers) can actively change language. Since language is a human-made discriminatory system, systemic choices - or changes - have to be made as well. Linguist Lann Hornscheidt points out that different typographies don’t need to be mutually exclusive. Several options can exist alongside each other. And new options will always continue to develop. When it comes to typographic options, it is recommendable to trust the communities in question and to use their preferred choices/forms of self-designation.

In German, the asterisk, underscore or colon are sometimes used to include all genders in gendered nouns. In both English and German, many people opt for the capitalisation of Black to mark it as a construced identity category with a particular history.

When it comes to especially [sensitive language](#harmful-language), rather than confront people outright with a term that might do harm, it can sometimes be wise to opt for formulations like ‘N-word’.
