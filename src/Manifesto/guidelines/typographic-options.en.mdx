[question of whether we gather a variety of these here, or only talk about these in general terms]
Could include Lann’s point that gender typographies in German don’t have to be mutually exclusive, we don’t have to pick one form and make it the new rule, there can be several, subject to change and context.
So could have a bit on the Sternchen, on the colon, on the Unterstrich
On capitalising Black or not
On italicising white or just the w, as in white (what they do at worten und meer, I think, or at least in Kindred)
Inserting asterisks as we did for the machtsprache site
Formulations like ‘the N-word’ (this and the above might assume readers know what is meant -> consider what audience knows, consider including a gloss, footnote, bracketed explainer etc)
