    'Translation is always a creative process. Translators can draw from creative solutions that various activist communities have developed.';

An enormous array of creative solutions are being sought and developed when it comes to politically sensitive language. These developments do not necessarily happen in the elite spaces of universities or similar, but are a part of the way language has always changed and adapted to new needs and environments. There is a long history of marginalised groups innovating linguistically. Language can become a tool to legitimize experiences and to assert power in cultures that donâ€™t give marginalised groups a lot of ways to do so. Translators can and should seek out creative solutions to the challenges that arise in translating with political sensitivity.

Many non-binary people in the English-speaking world use the pronouns they/them, as an alternative to the prescriptive binary of she/he and her/him, with which they do not wish to identify. Instead of retaining they/them in German, translators could use creative solutions that queer communities in Germany have developed, such as sif, sier or xier. These neopronouns have not (yet) become established in the mainstream, thus translators should not forget to consider the [genre and register](#genre) of their text to determine whether a creative solution is the best fit.
