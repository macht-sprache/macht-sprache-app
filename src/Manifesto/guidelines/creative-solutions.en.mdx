    'Translation is always a creative process. Translators can draw from creative solutions that various activist communities have developed.';

An enormous array of creative solutions are being sought and developed when it comes to politically sensitive language. As Lann Hornscheidt and many linguists point out, these developments do not necessarily happen in the elite spaces of universities or similar, but are a part of the way language has always changed and adapted to new needs and environments. In fact, there exists a long history of marginalised groups innovating linguistically. Language can become a tool to legitimize experiences and to assert power in cultures that don’t give marginalised groups a lot of ways to do that. Translators can and should seek out creative solutions to the challenges that arise in translating with political sensitivity.
