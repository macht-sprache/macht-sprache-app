    'Tone is a lens through which to understand attitude. A translator’s sense of tone helps them do the work of interpreting a text.';

Digital tools that work with language and translation seldom recognise tone and attitude. macht.sprache.'s [text checker](/text-checker) does not aim to encourage humourless translations. Nor does it want to censor what might be effective satirical or ironic uses of language which work to undercut the discrimination they put up for scrutiny. Assessing tone and attitude must remain in the hands of the human translator.

Judyta Smykowski, Jonas Karpa and Raul Krauthausen open their Podcast Die Neue Norm (The New Norm) by saying “Eine Sehbehinderung und zwei Rollstühle oder drei Journalist:innen sprechen über Behinderung, Inklusion und Gesellschaft.” (A visual disability and two wheelchairs, or three journalists, discuss disability, inclusion and society.) Their podcast is hosted by "Bayern 3", the public broadcaster in the German state of Bavaria, so they are addressing a general audience of disabled and able-bodied people. They assume that their audience will understand the tone and realise that people should not be reduced to a disability. The tone is humourous, but their attitude is critical of stereotypical representations of disabled people.

Translating their show - or producing bilingual social media content for it - would require a translator to capture the humour. Tone indicates how someone makes sense of the world and this is shaped by cultural values and ideas. The tone and attitude of a text and its translation are thus likley to be [context-specific](#context-specificity). They also relate significantly to the [positionalities](#positionalities) of author, translator and audience.
