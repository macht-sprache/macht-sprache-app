export const title = 'Tone and attitude';

Digital tools that work with language and translation seldomly recognise tone and attitude. The aim of this tool is not to encourage humourless translations or censor what might be effective satirical or ironic uses of language which work to undercut the discrimination they put up for scrutiny. Assessing this is something that must remain in the hands of the human translator. The tone and attitude of a text and its translation can, nonetheless, be context-specific [link] and relate significantly to the positionality of author, translator and audience [link].
