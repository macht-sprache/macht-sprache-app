## Developing macht.sprache.

Many voices and views have contributed to the making of macht.sprache. The knowledge and content that have flowed into its development were collaboratively produced. The team behind the project also drew insights from various expert voices who work with language(s) including Mirjam Nuenning, Michaela Dudley, Lann Hornscheidt, Şeyda Kurt, Anabelle Assaf, Amy Zayed, Khairani Barokka, and many others.

[Lucy Gasser and Anna von Rath of poco.lit., Kolja Lange and Timur Celikel](/about#Who-we-are) initiated the project and curated the recommendations. Lisa Nechutnys supported the project for four months. A collaborative approach was fundamental to the project’s effort to bring together different points of view. Nonetheless, it is inflected by the limitations of our own positionalities and privileges.

The project received funding from the Berlin Senate and the Prototype Fund.
