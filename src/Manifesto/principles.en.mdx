## Fundamental principles

The following three points summarise the understaning of translation that macht.sprache. advocates and recommends. For each fundamental principle you can find an explanation and one or two terms as examples. If you click on the terms, you can join the discussion.

    intro="Language constantly changes. Those invested in making language less discriminatory must be willing to develop new strategies to tackle the challenges that arise.">

Language constantly changes, as do understandings of what constitutes political sensitivity. While queer was once a slur, queer communities have successfully appropriated the word for empowering purposes after years of hard work. N\*\*\*o, by contrast, was once used as a self-designation by Black people fighting racism, but is now generally understood as a racist term. As discussions about political sensitivity develop, so too will the language that best supports them. This means that a [text checker](/text-checker) like the one offered here is subject to ongoing change and development, and this is as it should be. As new challenges present themselves, those invested in making language less discriminatory must be willing to develop new strategies to tackle those problems. The project for political sensitivity in translation is not a static one. The suggestions presented here make no claim to permanence or comprehensiveness. To centre the incomplete is to try to subvert the violence and control that can emerge from ideas of both completion and lack. This manifesto should be read as an appeal for more openness for linguistic change, and also for [linguistic play](#creative-solutions).

    title="Collaboration"
    domId="collaboration"
    intro="No-one is an expert on everything. Collaboration lets translators learn from each other.">

Translators often have several roles. Some work in the field of public relations or as lecturers at a university, others may be journalists or involved in activism. Translators build on their various areas of expertise. Collaborating, networking and working in teams can allow these areas of expertise to complement each other. This can be done over a coffee with a friend, with the help of social media, or here on macht.sprache. To ask (and pay) a sensitivity reader might also be an option.

You can use the [text checker](/text-checker) to get advice on particular terms. If there is a term that isn’t highlighted, but you think it should be, you can add it. If the information that the text checker provides is not enough for you to make a decision for your translation, you can head to the page of the term in question and seek input from other users.

    title="Pragmatic solutions"
    domId="pragmatic-solutions"
    intro="Translation often requires pragmatic solutions. These should be future-oriented, accessible and creative.">

Many of the questions that arise when considering politically sensitive translation are complex and warrant careful consideration. At the same time, the aim of the [text checker](/text-checker) is to offer a practical aid to people working with translations. Because a bilingual social media post or event announcement needs to be published, a translated book needs to be handed in, or an email needs to be sent out in a language that isn’t your mother tongue, translation often requires pragmatic solutions.

Translators have to bear with [change and incompleteness](#change-and-incompleteness). A pragmatic approach acknowledges that translations are rarely perfect. Sometimes decisions need to be made that weigh the different considerations at stake. Some concerns end up becoming a priority at the expense of others. In making pragmatic decisions, it is important to be sensitive to the different factors that need to be weighed. This manifesto is an invitation to make future-oriented, accessible and creative choices based on several [overarching](#typographic-options) [guidelines](#creative-solutions). To be pragmatic means to try new things and to stay error-friendly.
