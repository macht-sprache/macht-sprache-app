## Overarching guidelines

The overarching guidelines are statements that the macht.sprache. team has developed to support translators in choosing the most appropriate term for their translation. Short explanations with examples and terms from the macht.sprache database serve to confirm the relevance of the individual points. The guidelines cannot be considered separately from each other. The links that allow clicking through the manifesto in different ways emphasise their interconnectedness.
