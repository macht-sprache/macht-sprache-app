## Shared Responsibilities

The overarching guidelines and the fundamental principles that this manifesto provides directly address translators. But translators work within larger structures which may make integrating sensitivity into their work more or less feasible. Literary translators, for instance, likely work with publishing houses. Marketing agencies sometimes employ public relations managers to produce content in several languages. The responsibility for a translation thus doesn't rest solely on the shoulders of the translator. Those with the power to select a translator need to make sure that they choose one who is the right fit for the job, especially considering their [positionality](#positionalities). And of course, there is a limit to what translators can do with too little time and too little payment for a job. Good quality work requires fair working conditions.
