The highlighted terms are nouns that label persons. While these terms are usually gender neutral in English,
in the German language they will have a grammatical gender assigned. We recommend taking extra care when translating
these terms.

Several variants have been developed in German to formulate such nouns in more gender-inclusive ways.
Another option is to look for a gender non-specific form of the noun but such forms are not always available.
Variants of gender-inclusive noun formulations include the internal-I (Binnen-I), the underscore (Unterstrich),
the asterisk (Sternchen) and the colon (Doppelpunkt).
